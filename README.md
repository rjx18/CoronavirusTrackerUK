This is a coronavirus tracker for the UK, with interactive subnational level graphs and a heatmap to track the spread of cases in England.

## Demo

UPDATE (12/10): The website no longer works because the previous GOV.UK API is no longer being updated, and the new GOV.UK dashboard has the same features and more, so I won't 
be trying to reinvent the wheel here, as they've done a pretty good job on it.
